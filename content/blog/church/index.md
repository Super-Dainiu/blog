## October 8: The Essence of Worship

> John 4:19-24
>
> 19 The woman said to Him, ‚ÄúSir, I see that You are a prophet. 20 Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you *Jews* say that the place where one ought to worship is in Jerusalem.‚Äù 21 Jesus replied, ‚ÄúWoman, believe Me, a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem. 22 You do not know what you worship; we do know what we worship, for salvation is from the Jews. 23 But a time is coming and is already here when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth; for the Father seeks such people to be His worshipers. 24 God is spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.‚Äù

### 1. Worship is not anchored by the ‚ÄúForm‚Äù (v21-22)

Worship is not anchored on the form, but it is about who -- who you are worshipping.

Wholehearted worship goes beyond the form. God also sees our heart and sees us inside out.

### 2. Worship is anchored by the ‚ÄúWho‚Äù (v23-24)

Who are we concerned about when we worship?

> Because God is so much greater than we are, there is a humanity and divine gap between God and us.

Because of this revealing of God to us through Jesus, we are able to know the Father, and worship the Father. üôåüèº

> John 14:6 -7
>
> 6 Jesus answered, ‚ÄúI am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. 7 If you really know me, you will know my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him.‚Äù

Jesus is the truth: he is the way, the truth, the life. He allows us to understand God and how relate with God‚Äôs Spirit in a new light, which is the Holy Spirit.

We stand in His presence because of what He has done for us. God is worthy of our wholehearted worship.

When we have the right perspective of the WHO, it will guide the HOW.
